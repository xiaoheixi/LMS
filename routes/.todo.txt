TODOS:


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADRIAN NOTES
- Lesson "short description" is displayed to the user even when they have not purchased the course. This should be a description of the lesson that
everyone can see.
- Lesson "long description" is hidden until you buy the course, and it should be the course content.
- Lessons should be created with a title starting "Lesson (number)" as the store shows each lesson in alphanumerical order.

Lines 322 for book a slot button in C:\Users\adria\Desktop\LWS\resources\views\frontend\courses\lesson.blade.php

Lines 98 - 115 for Live Lessons options in admin panel C:\Users\adria\Desktop\LWS\resources\views\backend\includes\sidebar.blade.php

- Lines 487-503 in C:\Users\adria\Desktop\LWS\resources\views\frontend\courses\course.blade.php for buy/add to cart buttons


start by having a teacher so we are going to create a margie account. then we'll set up permissions then go from scratch create a user validate
 their account through email we are going to buy actually no no no before that we are going to run though the website
and how it looks before signing in and make sure all that works and then after we sign in how the website looks uh we going to attempt
 to purchase a live lesson which was already created by margie uh then we going to open the live lesson and see if we can actually
get it to work uh so thats it i think thats all we have to test oh and at the end we might test the admin functionality adding and removing
 account tell me when you got it all


create margie account
set up permissions
create user
validate account
check out how the website looks unsigned in
live lesson
adding and removing accounts
remove all other payment methods
link social media





NOTES

- Text is to be added to the backdrop image on the carousel.
- Latest blogs is to be replaced with popular blogs which are randomly selected.
- Teachers section is to be changed with Margie and the all teachers button is to be removed.
- Social media at the bottom should be made more prominent.
- Work on store functionality.




















Hello team,
We have been trying to integrate the template/theme you have sent us for the Spanish Learning Website but after integration the login functionality seemed to have been broken.

We've tried many things to fix this problem. We've tried the following things.

Using this in auth.php.
'providers' => [
'admins' => [ 'driver' => 'eloquent', 'model' => App\Models\Admin::class, ],

Using SESSION_DRIVER=redis in .env.

Regards,
Justin and Adrian
